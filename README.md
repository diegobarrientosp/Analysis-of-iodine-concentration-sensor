# Analysis-of-iodine-concentration-sensor

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the performance of a newly installed sensor designed to measure the concentration of iodine in kerosene based on the solution's color. The goal is to replace manual laboratory analysis with real-time data for better control of the solvent extraction process. By cross-referencing the sensor data stored in the control system (PLC) with laboratory results, the analysis aims to evaluate the accuracy of the sensor and propose improvements to enhance its performance.

## Objectives
- Evaluate Sensor Accuracy: Cross-reference the sensor data with laboratory measurements to assess how accurately the sensor reflects the iodine concentration in kerosene.
- Identify Measurement Discrepancies: Analyze differences between the sensor and laboratory data to determine potential sources of error or inconsistency.
- Propose Design Improvements: Develop actionable recommendations, such as applying correction factors or making design changes to the sensor, to enhance its reliability and accuracy in the industrial process.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Library**: pandas, seaborn and matplotlib
- **Data Sources**: Data from the control system (plc) and lab analysis

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw data.
- `notebooks/`: Includes the Jupyter notebook with the main analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, describing the project.
